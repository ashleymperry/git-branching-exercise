/* What git command creates a branch?
    git checkout -b
What is the difference between a fast-forward and recursive merge?
    While working on a new branch, fast-forwards can only be performed if no commits have been made
    on the original branch.
What git command changes to another branch?
    git checkout
What git command deletes a branch?
    git branch -D
How do merge conflicts happen?
    Different commits with changes have been made to the same file so git is unable to pick which file to merge. */
